# Descriptive Statistics

## Tukey Five-Number Summaries

* Description: Returns Tukey's five number summary (minimum, lower-hinge, median, upper-hinge, maximum) for the input data.
* Usage:  
``` R
fivenum(x, na.rm = TRUE)
```
* Arguments:  
    * `x`: numeric, maybe including NAs and $\pmÂ±Inf$s.
    * na.rm : logical; if TRUE, all NA and NaNs are dropped, before the statistics are computed.  
    
* Value
    * A numeric vector of length 5 containing the summary information. See `boxplot.stats` for more details.

``` R
# Load the file
mucus <- read.csv("MucusCells(1).csv")

summary(mucus)
     Cells          Group          
 Min.   : 8.00   Length:20         
 1st Qu.:10.00   Class :character  
 Median :12.50   Mode  :character  
 Mean   :12.75                     
 3rd Qu.:15.25                     
 Max.   :18.00  

# Get the five number stats
fivenum(mucus$Cells)
#    0 % 25 % 50 % 75 % 100 %
[1]  8.0 10.0 12.5 15.5 18.0
```

## IQR (Inter-Quartile Range)

* Description: computes interquartile range of the x values.
* Usage:  

``` R
IQR(x, na.rm = FALSE, type = 7)
```
* Arguments
    * `x` :	 a numeric vector.
    * na.rm	: logical. Should missing values be removed?
    * type : an integer selecting one of the many quantile algorithms, see quantile.
* Details : Note that this function computes the quartiles using the quantile function rather than following Tukey's recommendations, i.e., IQR(x) = quantile(x, 3/4) - quantile(x, 1/4).
* For normally N(m,1)N(m,1) distributed XX, the expected value of IQR(X) is 2*qnorm(3/4) = 1.3490, i.e., for a normal-consistent estimate of the standard deviation, use IQR(x) / 1.349.  

``` R
IQR(mucus$Cells)
[1] 5.5
```

**Return value depends on the algorithm used.**  

## Boxplot

* Description: Produce box-and-whisker plot(s) of the given (grouped) values.
* Usage:  

``` R
boxplot(x, ...)

## S3 method for class 'formula'
boxplot(formula, data = NULL, ..., subset, na.action = NULL,
        xlab = mklab(y_var = horizontal),
        ylab = mklab(y_var =!horizontal),
        add = FALSE, ann = !add, horizontal = FALSE,
        drop = FALSE, sep = ".", lex.order = FALSE)

## Default S3 method:
boxplot(x, ..., range = 1.5, width = NULL, varwidth = FALSE,
        notch = FALSE, outline = TRUE, names, plot = TRUE,
        border = par("fg"), col = "lightgray", log = "",
        pars = list(boxwex = 0.8, staplewex = 0.5, outwex = 0.5),
         ann = !add, horizontal = FALSE, add = FALSE, at = NULL)
```

* Arguments
    * formula: a formula, such as y ~ grp, where y is a numeric vector of data values to be split into groups according to the grouping variable grp (usually a factor). Note that ~ g1 + g2 is equivalent to g1:g2.
    * data: a data.frame (or list) from which the variables in formula should be taken.
    * subset: an optional vector specifying a subset of observations to be used for plotting.
    * na.action: a function which indicates what should happen when the data contain NAs. The default is to ignore missing values in either the response or the group.
    * xlab, ylab:  x- and y-axis annotation, since R 3.6.0 with a non-empty default. Can be suppressed by ann=FALSE.
    * ann: logical indicating if axes should be annotated (by xlab and ylab).  

``` R
boxplot(Cells ~ Group, mucus)
```

## Aggregate

Compute Summary Statistics of Data Subsets
* Description: Splits the data into subsets, computes summary statistics for each, and returns the result in a convenient form.
* Usage:

``` R
aggregate(x, ...)

## Default S3 method:
aggregate(x, ...)

## S3 method for class 'data.frame'
aggregate(x, by, FUN, ..., simplify = TRUE, drop = TRUE)
```

* Arguments
    * x: an R object. For the formula method a formula, such as y ~ x or cbind(y1, y2) ~ x1 + x2, where the y variables are numeric data to be split into groups according to the grouping x variables (usually factors).
    * by: a list of grouping elements, each as long as the variables in the data frame x. The elements are coerced to factors before use.
    * FUN: a function to compute the summary statistics which can be applied to all data subsets.

``` R
# Aggregate Means by Group
aggregate(Cells ~ Group, mucus, mean)
      Group Cells
1   Exposed  11.0
2 Untreated  14.5

# Aggregate SD by Group
aggregate(Cells ~ Group, mucus, sd)
      Group    Cells
1   Exposed 2.309401
2 Untreated 2.798809
```

## Sample Standard Deviation

* `s` is the sample standard deviation, `n` is the sample size.   

$$
\begin{align*}
    s &= \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x_j - \overline{x})^2}{n-1}}
\end{align*}
$$

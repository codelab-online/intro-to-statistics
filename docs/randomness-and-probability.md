# Randomness and Probability Theory

## Conditional Probability

$$
\begin{equation*}
    P(A | B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
\end{equation*}
$$

## Expected Value ($\mu$) and Variance (Discrete Probability)

* The expected value of a discrte distribution is the sum of the value multiplied that probability of the value occuring.  
$$
\begin{equation*}
    \mathbb{E}[X] = \mu = \sum x \cdot P(X=x)
\end{equation*}
$$  
* We can quantify the variability of a discrete random variable using squared deviations about the mean.  
$$
\begin{align*}
    Var(X) &= \sum P(X=x) \cdot (x - \mu)^2  \\  
    SD(X) &= \sqrt{Var(X)}
\end{align*}
